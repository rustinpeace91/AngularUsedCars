# Used Car Storefront 

This app is a demo of a Used Car storefront built in Angular 6. For now it is just a front end app with JSON data filling in for a database. In the future I plan to connect it to an actual MongoDB database. The app features a landing page, a dynamically updated toolbar, a set of tabs displaying the used cars, and a form to submit new used cars. It is a work in progress at the moment. 

A Live version of the App can be found here: https://rustinpeace91.github.io/AngularUsedCars/
